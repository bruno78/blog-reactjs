Blogging app using React JS and Flux

The blog app will make use of the following technologies and tools:

* Node.js for package management and server-side rendering
* React for UI views
* Express for an easy back-end JS server framework
* React Router for routing
* React Hot Loader for hot loading in development
* Flux for data flow
* Cosmic JS for content management

The challenges offered in this tutorial, besides learning a totally different and new concept, were basically updating the library components that were already outdated or deprecated, making the updated components work with each other and the old ones.
